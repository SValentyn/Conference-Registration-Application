# Conference_JavaFX

Description project: The resource folder contains: the server application (conference window) and the client application (registration window). The basis is the use of RMI technology and the JavaFX library. Also work with xml-files (saving and reading) was implemented. A Model-View-Controller data sharing scheme was used.
