The basis is the use of [RMI technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation) and the JavaFX library. Also work with [XML files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (saving and reading) was implemented. A [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) data sharing scheme was used. In addition, the repository contains a similar project, but written using Swing library.
